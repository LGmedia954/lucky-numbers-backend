# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)



# ALREADY INGESTED -- User.create(email: "lgworldcom@gmail.com", username: "Leslie")

# TEST ROUND MANUAL ADD -- Les.rounds.create(title: "Lotto", pick_one: 1, pick_two: 2, pick_three: 3, pick_four: 4, pick_five: 5, pick_six: 6, user_id: 1)
